# Version 1.5.0
*03.04.2020*

## New possibilities for `mouse` actions

Added the possibility to place the mouse cursor with much more accuracy:

- If there are several instances if an expected text on the sceen you can specify which one interests you;
- You can navigate the cursor inside the text instance;
- After the cursor positioning inside the text instance you can move it to the right left up or down as much as you need;
- All the specifiers are also available as methods and functions inside JS-selectors.

See [here](/en/docs/lang/mouse) for more information.

## Adjustment for the default values of timeouts and intervals in actions

Added the posibility to change the default values for timeouts and intervals using special (reserved) params.

See [here](/en/docs/lang/param) for more information.

## `interval` specificator for `type` actions

Now you can adjust typing speed in `type` actions with changing the interval between the key pressings.

See [here](/en/docs/lang/actions_vm#type) for more information.

## JS-selectors changes

JS-selectors are re-developed and now have new classes and functions. Backward compatibility is lost.

See [here](/en/docs/js/general) for more information.
