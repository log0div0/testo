## GPU-accelerated screen contents detection

Testo Framework now have two distributives:

1. With CPU-driven neural network processing
2. With GPU-driven neural network processing

Right now can guarantee Testo support for videocards NVIDIA GTX 1050 and higher. Nvidia-provided driver is required.

## Adjustment for the files checksumming threshold

With the new command line argument `--content_cksum_maxsize` you can change the maximum size of files which have checksum calculated based on the contents (not a Last Modify timestamp). Default value is 1 Megabyte.

See [here](/en/docs/lang/test) and [here](/en/docs/lang/machine) for more information.

## Selective semantic checks

Semantic analysis is now done only for the tests you want to run (according to the `--test_spec` and `--exclude` command line arguments).

Only the virtual machines and flash drives mentioned on these tests are undergone the semantic checks.

Basically it means you don't need to have actual artifacts (iso-images, copyto files and so on) for tests you don't want to run.

## `cpus` attribute in virtual machine declarations

The `cpus` attribute now doesn't stand for number of virtual CPUs in the virtual machine, but rather for number of Cores. The CPU is always single now.

## New keyabord keys

Now `press` support NumPad keys.

See [here](/en/docs/lang/keys) for more information.
