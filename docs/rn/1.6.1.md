# Version 1.6.1
*20.06.2020*

## Self-building

We are glad to inform you that Testo Framework has reached a new step in its lifecycle. Version 1.6.1 is the first Testo version which was build by the Testo itself. Yes, Testo  is a tests automation framework but it doesn't mean you can't automate other tasks with it (for example, building a project or deploying a Virtual Test Bench for debugging puproses). Keep that in mind when doing your routines for a 100-th time.
