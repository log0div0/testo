# Version 1.6.2
*29.06.2020*

## EULA changes

Since the 1.6.2 version CPU-based Testo is free for commercial and non-commercial use. CPU-based Testo now doesn't support the `--license` command line argument. GPU-based Testo has the same EULA terms as before, the `--license` command line argument is still required. You can check the whole EULA [here](/en/eula).

## Debian 9+ support

Now Testo Framework runs on Debian 9+ operating systems.

## Fixes

- Fixed a bug leading to occasional crashes of the guest addition service in Windows guests.
