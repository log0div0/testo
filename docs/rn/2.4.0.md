## Macros to generate tests and test benches

There is a new type of macros in Testo-lang: macros with declarations. These macros can encapsulate declarations of virtual entities and tests. See [here](/en/docs/lang/macro#macros-with-declarations) for more information.

## Parameterizing number of pressings in "press" actions 

Now it's possible to parameterize the number of pressings in `press` actions. For more information see [here](/en/docs/lang/actions_fd#key-specification)

## nocheck optional specifier for "copyto" actions

Now it's possile to disable semantic checks of files existence on the Host in `copyto` actions. Thanks to this, you can now run tests with `copyto` actions even if there's no necessary files present of the Host at the moment of running tests. It is assumed that the files will appear on the Host by the time of the actual copying.
